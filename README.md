Shift Cipher challenge
======================

## Goal

Your challenge is to complete a shift cipher challenge that can encode and
decode simple phrases.  You will know that your have completed the challenge
when all tests complete successfully.

## What is a shift cipher?

Shift ciphers are also called Caesar ciphers as they were used by Julius Caesar
to scramble his messages to military personnel, so that they were purposefully
unintelligible to any unintended reader.

Using a shift cipher is a simple and well-known (albeit usually insecure!)
encryption technique, and a suitable topic for the focus of our challenge. In a
simple shift cipher, a given input phrase is shifted by a certain number of
characters so that it is no longer legible.

When using a shift of `1`, each letter in the input text will be modified to
the next letter. For example, we could encode:

`foobar` -> `gppcbs`

To decode, we can simply reverse the shift:

`gppcbs` -> `foobar`

When using a shift of `10`:

Encode: `foobar` -> `pyylkb`

Decode: `pyylkb` -> `foobar`

Our implementation of the shift cipher is a simple one:
- For encoding, the input text should be shifted by `n` characters, with a
  default shift of 1
- For decoding, encoded text should be shifted back and return the original
  input text.
- When a shift causes a letter to pass the end of the alphabet, it should wrap
  to the beginning. For example, `z` shifted by 1 should become `a`.

We have provided you with a `Cipher` class with two class methods: `encode`
and `decode`.  Both methods take two arguments: `input` and `distance`. You
will notice that the tests do not always specify `distance`, so a default may
be necessary.

## Download

Fork this repository to your own account and clone it, or download it as a zip
and extract the files.

## Run

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the challenge directory.
2. Run `gem install minitest`.
3. Run `ruby cipher_test.rb` to test the challenge.
4. On the first run, Minitest should output the following:

```ruby
n runs, 0 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, n skips
```

## Complete

- The project contains two files: `cipher_test.rb` and `cipher.rb`. You will
  need to modify both of these files.
- Any code changes should be placed in `cipher.rb`. We have created a class in
  this file for you to build on.
- `skip` statements in `cipher_test.rb` should be commented out as you begin to
  test your code.
- You are encouraged to make this an iterative TDD process: comment out one
  _skip_ statement and run the tests to ensure they pass. Then proceed to the
  commenting out the next _skip_ statement and repeat the process.
- **The challenge is considered complete once all _skip_ statements are
  commented out and all tests pass** (_0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips_).

## Submit

- If you forked the repository, ensure your repo is public, your changes are
  committed and pushed, and send us a link to your repository via email.
- If you downloaded the repository as a zip file, zip your changes and send
  them to us via an email attachment.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure you have ruby installed (`ruby -v`)
- Ensure you have minitest installed (`gem install minitest`)
- Ensure you are in the challenge directory
